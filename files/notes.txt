# Four Square Method for analyzing the numbers on a rental property

# Hypothetical property: duplex at $200,000 (number doesn't matter)
# each unit rents for $1000 each
# gross monthly income : $2,000 a month

# 1) Income
# - rental income (most common income): gross monthly income $2,000 a month
# - laundry income
# - storage income (storage shed)
# - misc. income
# TOTAL MONTHLY INCOME: $2,000 per month (all income added together)

# 2) Expenses (Monthly)
# - taxes : assume $150/month
# - insurance on a property : assume $100/month
# (sometimes tax/insurance is included in the mortgage)
# - utilities (water, electric, sewer, garbage, gas) : $0 (tenant pays all)
# - HOA fees :  $0
# - lawn/snow care : $0 tenant will handle
# - vacancy (every month we want to set aside a little money knowing that at some point it's going to go vacant) : estimate 3-5% vacancy (5% of rental income) ($100)
# - repairs : around $50-100 per unit per month?
# - capEx (capital expendisures) - setting aside a little money a month for big expenses; linked with repairs, but replacing things : $100/month
# - property management : might pay property manager 10% rental income ($200/month)
# - mortgage (if you don't pay cash) : can use online free mortgage calculator. hypothetically $160,000 mortgage at 5% interest over 40year span: $860/month
# TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES (everything added up): $1610 (all expenses added together)

# 3) Cash Flow: (how much extra money do I have per month)
# income - expenses
# $2,000 - $1,610 per month: $390/month
# TOTAL MONTHLY CASH FLOW: $390/month

# 4) Cash on Cash ROI (Return on Investment)
# - Down Payment say usually 20%: $40,000
# - Closing Costs (people we had to pay), say $3,000
# - Repair money / rehab budget, say $7,000 (painting the property)
# - Misc other, say $0
# TOTAL INVESTMENT: $50,000
# Annual Cash Flow: Total Monthly Cash Flow (^ #3) x 12 : $390 x 12 = $4,680

# ROI = Annual Cash Flow / Total Investment
# ROI = $4,680 / $50,000 = .0936 => 9.36%
# Cash on Cash ROI = 9.36%

# What is a good Cash on Cash ROI?
# Depends on your goals/strategies
# Stocks have been 6-7% average so this actually does better

# Harder: Overall (Total) Return and your Internal Rate of Return (Equity)
# What if your property was worth more than you originally bought it for?
